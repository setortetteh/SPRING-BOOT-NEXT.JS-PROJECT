## ðŸ”„ Software Development Process Documentation

### 1. Requirements Gathering

#### 1.1 Stakeholder Identification
- **Primary Users**: Students, Academic Administrators, System Administrators
- **Secondary Users**: Faculty, Department Heads, IT Support

#### 1.2 Functional Requirements
- **Java 17** - Runtime environment

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database
- **Database Name**: `ug_student_portal`

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
2. **Java 17** (JDK)
3. **PostgreSQL** (v12 or higher)
4. **Maven** (for backend build)

## Local Development Setup

### 1. Database Setup

1. Install PostgreSQL and start the service
2. Create the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE ug_student_portal;
   ```
3. Run the database setup script:
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -d ug_student_portal -f scripts/setup-local-database.sql
   ```

### 2. Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Update database credentials in `src/main/resources/application.properties` if needed:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

3. Build and run the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`

### 3. Frontend Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Database Schema

   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `name` (VARCHAR)
   - `student_id` (VARCHAR, Unique)
   - `email` (VARCHAR, Unique)
   - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
   - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

2. **login_sessions** - Tracks user login sessions
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `student_id` (VARCHAR, Foreign Key)
   - `name` (VARCHAR)
   - `email` (VARCHAR)
   - `login_time` (TIMESTAMP)
   - `logout_time` (TIMESTAMP)
   - `session_status` (VARCHAR)
   - `ip_address` (VARCHAR)
   - `user_agent` (TEXT)

3. **admins** - Contains administrative users
   - `id` (Primary Key)
   - `name` (VARCHAR)
   - `admin_id` (VARCHAR, Unique)
   - `email` (VARCHAR)
   - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)

### Views

## Features

### Student Features
- Student registration and login
- Academic services dashboard
- Course registration (UI ready)
- Grade viewing (UI ready)
- Academic calendar (UI ready)
- Library services (UI ready)
- Financial aid (UI ready)

### Admin Features

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Student login

### Admin Dashboard
- `GET /api/admin/dashboard-stats` - Get dashboard statistics
- `GET /api/admin/logged-students` - Get currently logged students

## Security Features

- Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- Connection pooling for efficient resource management
- Session tracking for user activity monitoring
- IP address and user agent logging for security auditing
- Input validation on both frontend and backend

## Development Notes

### Frontend Database Integration
The frontend connects directly to PostgreSQL through a connection pool configured in `lib/db.ts`. This allows the frontend to handle database operations for features that don't require complex business logic.

### Admin Authentication
Admin login is handled entirely on the frontend without backend verification for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, this should be implemented with proper authentication and authorization.

### Session Management
The application tracks login sessions in the database and maintains active sessions to show currently logged-in users. Sessions are marked as active until explicitly logged out.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Error**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running
   - Verify database credentials in `application.properties`
   - Check if the database `ug_student_portal` exists

2. **Port Already in Use**
   - Backend: Change port in `application.properties`
   - Frontend: Change port in `package.json` scripts

3. **Dependencies Not Found**
   - Run `npm install` for frontend dependencies
   - Run `mvn clean install` for backend dependencies
