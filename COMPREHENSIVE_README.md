```

#### 2.2 Database Design

**Core Entities:**
- **Students**: Student information and authentication
- **Courses**: Course catalog and details
- **Enrollments**: Student-course relationships
- **Grades**: Individual assignment grades and calculations
- **Admins**: Administrative user accounts

**Key Relationships:**
- Students ↔ Enrollments ↔ Courses (Many-to-Many)
- Enrollments ↔ Grades (One-to-Many)
- Courses ↔ Grades (One-to-Many)

#### 2.3 API Specification

**Student APIs:**
- `GET /api/student/courses` - Course registration management
- `GET /api/student/grades` - Grades and GPA calculation
- `POST /api/auth/student-login` - Student authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Student registration

**Admin APIs:**
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/courses` - Course management
- `GET /api/admin/enrollments` - Enrollment tracking
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/grades` - Grade assignment

### 3. System Design

#### 3.1 User Interface Design

**Design Principles:**
- **Consistency**: Unified design language across all components
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **University Branding**: University of Ghana color scheme and branding

**Key UI Components:**
- Dashboard with statistical overview
- Data tables with search, filter, and pagination
- Modal forms for data entry
- Real-time status indicators
- Interactive charts and graphs

#### 3.2 GPA Calculation Algorithm

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
GPA = Σ(Grade Points × Credit Hours) / Σ(Credit Hours)

Where:
- Grade Points = Converted from letter grades (A=4.0, B+=3.3, etc.)
- Letter Grades = Converted from course percentages
- Course Percentage = Average of all assignment scores
```

**Implementation:**
1. Calculate course percentage from individual assignments
2. Convert percentage to letter grade using grading scale
3. Map letter grade to grade points
4. Calculate quality points (grade points × credit hours)
5. Sum all quality points and divide by total credit hours
